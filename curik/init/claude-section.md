# Curik Curriculum Project

This repository is a Curik-managed curriculum project for the League of Amazing Programmers.

## Before You Do Anything

1. Call `get_course_status()` to determine where this project stands.
2. Call `get_process_guide()` to understand what to do next.
3. Follow the process guide's instructions for the current phase.

Do not write curriculum content, modify course structure, scaffold files, or make any substantive changes without first consulting the MCP server for the current phase and the applicable agent.

## Hugo Theme

The Hugo theme lives at `themes/curriculum-hugo-theme/` in this repo. Curik
copies it there during scaffolding. Do not modify it — changes go upstream
in the curik package. Hugo finds it automatically via `theme = "curriculum-hugo-theme"`
in `hugo.toml`.

## Rules

- **MCP-first**: For any operation that Curik has a tool for (creating issues, managing change plans, scaffolding, validation, syllabus operations), use the Curik MCP tool. Do not perform these operations by directly editing files.
- **Agent boundaries**: When you load an agent definition via `get_agent()`, respect its boundaries. The Curriculum Architect does not write lesson content. The Lesson Author does not modify course structure.
- **Skills are workflows**: When you load a skill via `get_skill()`, follow its steps in order. Do not skip steps.
- **Gates are gates**: When `advance_phase()` fails, do not work around it. Address the unmet conditions.
- **Designer approval**: Change plans, outlines, and phase transitions require designer approval. Do not self-approve.
- **Theme is read-only**: Do not edit files in `themes/`. The theme is managed by the curik package.
- **No TBDs in course.yml**: After scaffolding, fill in all `course.yml` fields using `tool_update_course_yml()`. Infer values from the spec and content, then present to the designer for review. Never leave TBD values — ask the designer if you cannot determine a field.

## Available MCP Tools

### Process Discovery
- `get_process_guide()` — full process overview and decision tree
- `get_course_status()` — current project state
- `get_phase()` — current phase and gate conditions
- `advance_phase()` — gated phase transition
- `get_activity_guide(activity)` — bundled agent + skills + instructions

### Agent and Skill Loading
- `list_agents()` / `get_agent(name)` — agent definitions
- `list_skills()` / `get_skill(name)` — skill workflows
- `list_instructions()` / `get_instruction(name)` — reference documents

### State Management
- Spec state: `record_course_concept`, `record_pedagogical_model`, `record_alignment`
- Scaffolding: `scaffold_structure`, `create_lesson_stub`
- Syllabus: `regenerate_syllabus`, `get_syllabus`, `write_syllabus_url`, `trigger_readme_generation`, `validate_syllabus_consistency`
- Outlines: `approve_outline`
- Issues and change plans: `create_issue`, `list_issues`, `approve_change_plan`, `close_change_plan`
- Validation: `validate_lesson`, `validate_module`, `validate_course`, `get_validation_report`
- Quiz: `generate_quiz_stub`, `validate_quiz_alignment`, `set_quiz_status`
- Course metadata: `update_course_yml` — set fields in course.yml (title, slug, tier, etc.)
- Hugo: `list_content_pages`, `create_content_page`, `update_frontmatter`, `hugo_build`
- Publishing: `get_publish_guide` — full guide with pre/post checklists; `check_publish_ready` — quick readiness check
